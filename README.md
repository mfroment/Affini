# Affini - A relationship builder that starts with you

Affini is a personal relationship manager built as our team's final project at the Le Wagon full-stack web development bootcamp. Created in ten days, the project was inspired by the book "The Rosie Project" by Graeme Simsion.

Modeled after popular CRM software, Affini allows you add connections, manage and track your activities with them using "Check-ins", and reminds you of any important events relevant to individual connections.

For each connection, it lets you set individual target frequency for checking in (weekly, monthly, etc), and computes an *Affinity* score to help you track how well you are doing.

I was the main backend developer. I also proposed and implemented differentiating features such as the *Affinity* score and the quick onboarding of imported contacts.
