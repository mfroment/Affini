Affini - A relationship builder that starts with you.

Affini is a personal relationship manager built as my final project at the Le Wagon full-stack web development bootcamp. Created in ten days, the project was inspired by the book "The Rosie Project" by Graeme Simsion. 

Modeled after popular CRM software, Affini allows you add connections, manage and track your activities with them using "Check-ins", and reminds you of any important events relevant to individual connections. 

I led the team as Lead Developer and product designer. I created the visual identity and directed the front-end development.
